UpdateWeeklyLinks
=================
Reddit - Update the "weekly" links in /r/books header that point to the weekly "recommendation" and "what are you reading threads and then tweets the post.  If the weekly post is not a "what are you reading" or "weekly recommendation", it simple tweets the post.

This one looks a little rough as it was one of the first ones I wrote and still barely knew python.  My more recent bots look a little better, but they're all pretty rough :)

This script is scheduled run shortly after AutoModerator posts a "weekly" post sometime around 5am ET.
